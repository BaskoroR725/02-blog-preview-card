## My process

### Built with

- **Semantic HTML5 markup** - Using tags like `<article>`, `<time>`, and `<footer>` for better SEO and accessibility.
- **CSS custom properties** - Managing the color palette systematically using `:root` variables.
- **Flexbox** - Utilized for centering the card and managing internal spacing with the `gap` property.
- **Mobile-first workflow** - Ensuring the design is robust on small screens before scaling up to desktop.

### What I learned

During this project, I revisited the importance of fundamental CSS before jumping back into frameworks. I focused on deep-diving into the CSS Box Model.

A major takeaway was learning how to use a "solid" `box-shadow` (0px blur) to match the design's sharp aesthetic. I also practiced fixing element overlapping by using Flexbox `gap` instead of relying solely on individual margins.

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to:

- Explore CSS Grid for more complex layout structures.

- Deepen my knowledge of Web Accessibility (A11y) to ensure my projects are usable for everyone.

- Implement BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming conventions to write more professional and scalable CSS.
